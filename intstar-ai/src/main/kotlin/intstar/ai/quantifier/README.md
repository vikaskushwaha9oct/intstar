**What makes an impactful story?**

By story here, I mean an organized collection of information, which would include things like articles, software
programs, novels, movies, ideas and many other human intellectual creations. Impactful-ness of a story can be explored
via these 3 questions:

1. **Can it be processed by the listener?**

a. _Abstract-ness_: Concrete concepts have higher number of clear relationships with other concepts, as compared to
abstract concepts. This makes it easier to visualize them. Imagination plays a role in processing more abstract
concepts.

b. _Working Memory Cost_: If processing a predicate, requires you to keep a large amount of concepts in your brain's
working memory, then it is harder to understand.

c. _Long-term Memory Cost_: More uncommon the concepts involved for the listener, more is the cost to retrieve those
concepts from long term memory.

d. _Pattern Complexity_: Complexity of the patterns that must be decoded by the listener to understand the story. How
the listener's brain represents concepts determines the ease-ness of spotting patterns.

2. **Is it sound, clear and makes sense to the listener?**

a. _Consistency_: Are there contradictions in the story? Is the story in line with the stated goals of the story.

b. _Conceptual Clarity_: How well different parts of the story fit in with existing knowledge? Are there clear
boundaries between various concepts?

3. **How it makes the listener feel (it determines motivation, which in turn decides the attention)?**

a. _Overwhelmed_: Feeling of being mentally tired.

b. _Unknown_: Familiar can be safe, secure or boring. Unfamiliar can be adventurous or scary, depending on context.

c. _Gain/Loss_: Does the story induce positive or negative memories/predictions.

d. _Balance_: We find balanced things to be more beautiful.

e. _Connection_: Feeling of being part of something larger than self, like spirituality, love, etc.

Above properties would conflict with each other. The role of the attention is to schedule execution of solvers, based on
which properties are most attention grabbing, and a bias built into the system as a proxy for "pre-disposition to
certain behaviours".

**Intelligence exhibited by the system** :

1) _Autocomplete intelligence_: The ability to look for and remember patterns and do actions based on them
2) _Storytelling intelligence_: The ability to tell a story requires logic, symbolism, questioning etc
3) _Control intelligence_: The ability to control/limit thinking/impluses

**Stability of the system** :
Long term stability of a system (anti-fragility) needs a balance of 3 categories of behaviours.

1) Sustenance: Baseline/ritualistic behaviours that system should perform regularly
2) Exploration: Allow system to experiment with new states in a stable manner. Connectivity determines the frequency at
   which we see new changes.
3) Defence: Control over internal/external stimuli, which can throw the system off
