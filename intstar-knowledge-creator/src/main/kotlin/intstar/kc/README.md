This module defines a system to allow humans to create knowledge in a standardized manner, so that it can be used by the
AI system to make decisions, or learn about new domains. It would be based on mcalculus, and includes switches to define
datasets, domain specific concept-bases, calculations & procedures, and UX switches to author these.
